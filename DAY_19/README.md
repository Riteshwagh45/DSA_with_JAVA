🔥 Solved 2 Hard Problems on LeetCode

Today was a big milestone in my DSA journey!
I successfully solved two Hard-level backtracking problems on LeetCode, which really strengthened my understanding of recursion, backtracking, and optimization 🧠♟️

🧩 Problems Solved:

✅ 51. N-Queens

Generated all valid board configurations

Focused on safe placements using recursion & backtracking

✅ 52. N-Queens II

Optimized version focusing on counting valid solutions

Same logic, better performance and clarity

Both solutions were accepted with strong runtime performance, reinforcing the importance of writing clean and efficient logic ⚡

💡 Key Learnings:

🔹 Backtracking requires patience and clear state management
🔹 Visualizing the chessboard helps avoid wrong placements
🔹 Optimized recursion can drastically improve performance
🔹 Solving Hard problems boosts confidence like nothing else 💪
